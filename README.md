I try to visualize the unemployment of US states from 1978 - 2016.

We have US map and time-series chart that show unemployment rates related to each states of US.
It also shows the national rate and sudden decrease (more than 3%) in this duration.

1- Data processing
    retreiving data from BLS website.
      writing a htmlparser program in java for doing that.
    pre-processing data with R-script.
      creating data for each states according to timeseries duration
2- Java script and D3 libraray
